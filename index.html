        <p>I am putting this post up to force myself to update it as I explore Burke Mountain. I hope to fill this post with all of the information that I can on long routes in Burke Mountain, cool places to get to, and good camp spots.</p>

<p>I will do my best to upload images, and of course will include maps of all of my routes.</p>

        <p>With the recent <a href="https://www.bancor.network/">Bancor</a> Initial Coin Offering (ICO) raking in over 150 million USD in ETH, it is undeniable that ICO’s are huge. They are hyped throughout the community, and they often sell out within hours, minutes, or even blocks.</p>

<p>With “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/50-million-hack-just-showed-dao-human/">The DAO</a>” incident still fresh in the memories of many, ICO’s can be a little worrying. This post will include the common concerns relating to the rapid ICO growth, and my opinion on their validity.</p>

        <p>I originally wrote this post for an open source project I worked on called <strong>TF2 Stadium</strong>. The post was originally available at <a href="http://blog.tf2stadium.com">http://blog.tf2stadium.com</a>. I am re posting it now since the blog has been shut down. It is mostly semi technical information that was released as teaser/promotional content in the early stages of development. TF2Stadium is a Team Fortress 2 <em>lobby</em> website where competitive players are matched with other players for practice matches.</p>

<p>Hello, and welcome to the first actual entry of the TF2Stadium developer blog. In this entry, we will summarize some of the technology that our site uses, as well as some of our design goals.</p>

<p>The programming of TF2Stadium–as well as most other sites–is split into two major groups: “frontend” and “backend”.</p>
