<p>Hello, and welcome to the first actual entry of the TF2Stadium developer blog. In this entry, we will summarize some of the technology that our site uses, as well as some of our design goals.</p>

<p>The programming of TF2Stadium–as well as most other sites–is split into two major groups: “frontend” and “backend”.</p>

<h5 id="the-frontend">The Frontend</h5>

<p>Frontend is everything from the way the page looks to the experience of using the site. The frontend is made up of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which together form the page that a user sees.</p>

<p>TF2Stadium is a Single Page Application, which means the entire site and most of its assets are loaded during the initial load of the page. After that, navigation does not require page loads, which in turn make the site much more responsive. This isn’t free of downsides however, such as a longer initial loading time and the necessity of using Javascript.</p>
