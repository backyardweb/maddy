        <p>This is a relatively long term review of “Dance Pants” as a piece of backpacking gear. Dance pants are an extremely cheap and quite effective alternative to popular ultralight wind pants. I got these pants for under $20, which is a much better deal than the current high end ultralight offerings. They weigh in around 3oz on my scale, but this will vary with size.</p>

<p>I am going to keep this review simple, just like this product. I have been using these pants for several months and hundreds of miles and they do their job perfectly. They do not have pockets, or really any features at all. They are held up with an elastic waist, and held down at the ankles by more elastic. They are very flexible in terms of stretch and layering. I have worn them with just underwear underneath and have been comfortable, but have also worn the pants with underwear, shorts and a base layer underneath in cold conditions and had no issues. It does not feel like you are wearing an additional waistband when you layer these pants because they are so light and the waistband is so stretchy. I forget that I am wearing these pants a lot of the time while hiking or sleeping, but they do their job of adding some warmth and reducing wind well.</p>

        <p>This post contains everything you might want to know about gear I use when backpacking, as well as some of my thoughts on gear choices. I have gotten some emails and messages about some items, so this is an effort to create something I can respond with. I am going to use this post as a place to link people to from other things such as future videos or posts as the one stop shop for my gear info. It will also contain some ramblings (more to come in the future) about gear and Ultralight ideas.</p>

<p>Like many, I follow most of the principals of Ultralight Backpacking. You will see this in some of my gear choices, but admittedly not all. I try to keep my base weight as low as possible, but it often varies between trips. Generally my base weight is under 10lbs, often much lower if conditions permit. I live in Vancouver, Canada, so weather and conditions are constantly changing. When I am out around home, I am often switching things up or taking more or less gear to suit the conditions. If you live somewhere where you can be certain it isn’t going to rain for the next 5 days, then you can adapt your gear accordingly!</p>

        <p>This week my friend Riley and I hiked up to Dennett Lake, on Burke Mountain. The 21km hike took a total of about five and a half hours, but could be knocked down to four and a half if you were really on a mission.</p>

<p>We followed the same route to Munro Lake as detailed in <a href="/posts/2018-08/Rospe-Trail">my last post</a>, so I won’t make a new map for this post. If you want the exact route, you can check out my <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1954090304">gps track</a>. Once you are at Munro lake, you should see a bare cliff on the other side of the lake. Head north (towards the cliff) from the area that the trail enters the lake, across the dried up section, and follow the edge of the lake counter clockwise until you see the trail on your left. There are some blue blazes on the first kilometer or so of this area.</p>

        <p>This post contains information about “The Rospe Trail” named after my friend Rospe. It mostly uses pre existing trails in Burke Mountain, and can  be used to get to Munro and Dennett lakes.</p>

<p>If you want to hike this trail you can park at the top of harper road. There is room for about 20-30 cars, and any time I have gone it has never been full. If it is, you could probably try parking at the gun range, but I’ve never tried that.</p>
