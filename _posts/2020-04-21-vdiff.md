In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic I worked on a tool for comparing genomes in C++.

![vdiff](/img/vdiff.png)

The vdiff command line tool provides information about two genomes, including the number of matching strings within two genomes, and the percentage of the genomes that are matching when aligned. This information is output via command line logging, as well as optional CSV match output for graphing.

My project [vdiff](https://github.com/tehp/vdiff) is available on GitHub.

Give it a shot yourself if you are interested the subject. The source code comes with some sample genomes that you can use. 

More information and instructions are available in this video:
