This post contains information about "The Rospe Trail" named after my friend Rospe. It mostly uses pre existing trails in Burke Mountain, and can  be used to get to Munro and Dennett lakes.

If you want to hike this trail you can park at the top of harper road. There is room for about 20-30 cars, and any time I have gone it has never been full. If it is, you could probably try parking at the gun range, but I've never tried that.

There are some random trail markings in different spots along this trail which can be a bit confusing, I would just ignore them completely and follow the map. If you are in doubt, head up. [Here is a link to the map we used](https://caltopo.com/m/6R6C). On the way up we followed a mountain biking trail north of the marked trail because it was a lot less steep. I'd recommend it on the way up or down if you prefer not seeing the same stuff twice.

The lakes are surprisingly big, and Munro lake has an awesome camping spot (not that I'm endorsing that). The site has a nice area to setup tents, and enough trees around that you could probably cowboy camp comfortably in nice weather.

We saw some black bears with cubs right at the trail head, but nothing much when we started to gain elevation.
