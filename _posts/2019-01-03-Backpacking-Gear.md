This post contains everything you might want to know about gear I use when backpacking. I have gotten some emails and messages about some items, so this is an effort to create something I can respond with. I am going to use this post as a place to link people to from other things such as future videos or posts as the one stop shop for my gear info. It will also contain some ramblings (more to come in the future) about gear and Ultralight ideas.

Like many, I follow most of the principals of Ultralight Backpacking. You will see this in some of my gear choices, but admittedly not all. I try to keep my base weight as low as possible, but it often varies between trips. Generally my base weight is under 10lbs, often much lower if conditions permit. I live in Vancouver, Canada, so weather and conditions are constantly changing. When I am out around home, I am often switching things up or taking more or less gear to suit the conditions. If you live somewhere where you can be certain it isn't going to rain for the next 5 days, then you can adapt your gear accordingly!

[My gear list](https://lighterpack.com/r/4qykgn) is on LighterPack, which is a nice website for viewing gear lists, as well as maintaining your own. You might think it's stupid to track your gear on a website, I know I did, but it actually turns out to be quite useful. It is very helpful to be able to visualize all of your gear in the way that LighterPack allows you to, and it can help you pick out pieces of gear that are just too heavy, or things that you don't need.

I suggest anyone reading this puts their gear into LighterPack. If you have a cheap kitchen scale, it is perfect for weighing your gear. If you don't, try to find weights from other peoples lists, or as a last resort from the manufacturer (it isn't a huge deal if you are off by a bit). I think anyone would benefit from seeing where the weight on their back comes from in a more detailed way. A final note about LighterPack: I like to put all of my gear into one list, even the stuff that I rarely use, or only bring sometimes. Once you have done that, you can easily adjust the quantity of each item on the far right of each row, and just set it to 0 if you don't plan to bring it. I don't care enough to maintain several lists, so this is the best way I have found to do it.
