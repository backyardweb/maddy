This week my friend Riley and I hiked up to Dennett Lake, on Burke Mountain. The 21km hike took a total of about five and a half hours, but could be knocked down to four and a half if you were really on a mission.

We followed the same route to Munro Lake as detailed in [my last post](/posts/2018-08/Rospe-Trail), so I won't make a new map for this post. If you want the exact route, you can check out my [gps track](https://www.strava.com/activities/1954090304). Once you are at Munro lake, you should see a bare cliff on the other side of the lake. Head north (towards the cliff) from the area that the trail enters the lake, across the dried up section, and follow the edge of the lake counter clockwise until you see the trail on your left. There are some blue blazes on the first kilometer or so of this area.

In general, the route has some steep portions but requires no technical climbing (although there were some cool climbing spots on the north side of Dennett Lake). At this time of year, a fair bit of the ground was frozen at the higher elevations, as well as some smaller water sources. The big ones were just starting to freeze around the edges. If you plan to visit later than early November, bring a little bit of extra water, or have a way to melt some.

The picture above is an awesome camping spot we found at Dennett lake, big enough for two or three small shelters.

The trail conditions get pretty dismal after Munro Lake. Most of the trail has become a stream, or a mud bog, and you may prefer to bushwhack at parts. If you are hiking when it's wet, bring breathable shoes, because you are going to get wet no matter what you wear.
